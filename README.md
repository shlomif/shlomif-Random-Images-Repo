This repository contains various images that I (= Shlomi Fish) have collected.

Here are some of the highlights:

* pysol-black-hole-solitaire-deal-1000-with-public-domain-tabletile.xcf.xz
- screenshot of PySolFC with a Black Hole Solitaire deal as used on Wikipedia/
Wikimedia Commons.

* tiger_standing.gif - a photo from a collection recommended by GIMP which
from what I recall was Public Domain.

* veronica_blume.png - a photo of a model - proprietary.
